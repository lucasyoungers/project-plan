# Orchid
**A Vue.js and Firebase Powered Messaging App**
> Orchid is a modern and streamlined messaging app for eliminating distractions and focusing on work. As the user clicks through the stylish and modern signup page, they are automatically brought to a global chat window. If they would rather work in a quieter environment, there is the option to create a group chat specifically for their friends. When the user is done, they click the sign out button, conviniently located in a prominent area at the top of the screen. When they come back, they must simply log in and resume whatever they were doing.
